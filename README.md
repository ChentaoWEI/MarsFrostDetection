# MarsFrostDetection
## Framework
This project utilizes **PyTorch** as the primary framework for model development and training.

## Project Structure

- **model/**: This directory contains the code for four different models implemented in this project.

- **saved_plot/**: Holds the plots of training and validation errors recorded during the training process.

- **dataloader/**: Includes a custom data loader script used for handling dataset operations.

- **train** scripts: Training scripts for different models, each named with a 'train' prefix.

- **compare_models.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook for testing and comparing the performance of the models.

- **saved_model/**: Originally for storing trained model files. Due to file size, they are hosted on Google Drive.
